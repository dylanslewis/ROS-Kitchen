{"name":"ROS-Kitchen","tagline":"","body":"Kitchen\r\n==========\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis App is part of the Restaurant Ordering System, and is designed to work alongside [Manager](http://dylanslewis.github.io/ROS-Manager/) and [Waiter](http://dylanslewis.github.io/ROS-Waiter/). \r\n\r\n## Current functionality\r\n\r\nKitchen currently only has core functionality and is still in development. However, the current version provides the following functionality:\r\n\r\n### Login\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i57.tinypic.com/23vj4nk.png\" align=\"center\" height=\"384\" width=\"512\">\r\n\r\nRestaurants login to the App using the credentials they used to create an account in [Manager](http://dylanslewis.github.io/ROS-Manager/).\r\n\r\n### Receiving orders\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i60.tinypic.com/j8hzip.png\" align=\"center\" height=\"384\" width=\"512\">\r\n\r\nOrders appear as soon as they have been ordered by waiters. Kitchen groups these orders by their table, and highlights important information such as the option that has been selected for that dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Setting estimates\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i58.tinypic.com/11ljx2h.png\" align=\"center\" height=\"384\" width=\"512\">\r\n\r\nEstimates are set by chefs to allow them to manage their current orders and to keep waiters in the loop about the order items' state. When chefs set estimates, they are shown all the other orders for that table, to help inform their decision and to ensure dishes of the same course are delivered together.\r\n\r\n### Managing current orders\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i61.tinypic.com/5k1t3b.png\" align=\"center\" height=\"384\" width=\"512\">\r\n\r\nExisting orders are displayed in a list, showing a countdown of to their estimated completion time. Future versions will allow chefs to organise this list in a way that suits their needs, such as filtering for specific tables.\r\n\r\n### Push notifications\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i62.tinypic.com/24ne55i.png\" align=\"center\" height=\"384\" width=\"512\">\r\nIt is vital for the kitchen to be aware of orders as soon as they happen, so notifications are sent to inform chefs even if their iPad's screen is off. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n\r\nThe app has the following known issues:  \r\n- unexpected crashes may occur as a result of heavy memory usage, which will be resolved in future iterations;  \r\n- fonts may not appear correctly at first throughout the app;  \r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\nIf you want to download and explore the App, please submit a pull request and use the following login credentials to view an account with pre-loaded data:  \r\nusername: *tester*  \r\npassword: *password*\r\n\r\n*Please note that Waiter has only been designed to work on an iPad (4th Generation) running iOS 8, currently. It will run on other devices running iOS 8, but you may experience multiple layout issues.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Future work\r\n\r\nThe Restaurant Ordering System is an ongoing project. Now that simple functionality has been implemented, the developer is working on enhancing the experience for chefs, and to cover less common use cases.","google":"UA-56777787-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
