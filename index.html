<h2>
<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This app is part of the Restaurant Ordering System, and is designed to work alongside <a href="http://dylanslewis.github.io/ROS-Manager/">Manager</a> and <a href="http://dylanslewis.github.io/ROS-Waiter/">Waiter</a>. </p>

<h2>
<a id="current-functionality" class="anchor" href="#current-functionality" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current functionality</h2>

<p>Kitchen currently only has core functionality and is still in development. However, the current version provides the following functionality:</p>

<h3>
<a id="login" class="anchor" href="#login" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Login</h3>

<p><img src="http://i57.tinypic.com/23vj4nk.png" align="center" height="384" width="512"></p>

<p>Restaurants login to the app using the credentials they used to create an account in <a href="http://dylanslewis.github.io/ROS-Manager/">Manager</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="receiving-orders" class="anchor" href="#receiving-orders" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Receiving orders</h3>

<p><img src="http://i60.tinypic.com/j8hzip.png" align="center" height="384" width="512"></p>

<p>Orders appear as soon as they have been ordered by waiters. Kitchen groups these orders by their table, and highlights important information such as the option that has been selected for that dish.</p>

<h3>
<a id="setting-estimates" class="anchor" href="#setting-estimates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setting estimates</h3>

<p><img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/11ljx2h.png" align="center" height="384" width="512"></p>

<p>Estimates are set by chefs to allow them to manage their current orders and to keep waiters in the loop about the order items' state. When chefs set estimates, they are shown all the other orders for that table, to help inform their decision and to ensure dishes of the same course are delivered together.</p>

<h3>
<a id="managing-current-orders" class="anchor" href="#managing-current-orders" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Managing current orders</h3>

<p><img src="http://i61.tinypic.com/5k1t3b.png" align="center" height="384" width="512"></p>

<p>Existing orders are displayed in a list, showing a countdown of to their estimated completion time. Future versions will allow chefs to organise this list in a way that suits their needs, such as filtering for specific tables.</p>

<h3>
<a id="push-notifications" class="anchor" href="#push-notifications" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Push notifications</h3>

<p><img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/24ne55i.png" align="center" height="384" width="512">
It is vital for the kitchen to be aware of orders as soon as they happen, so notifications are sent to inform chefs even if their iPad's screen is off. </p>

<h2>
<a id="known-issues" class="anchor" href="#known-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Known issues</h2>

<p>The app has the following known issues:  </p>

<ul>
<li>unexpected crashes may occur as a result of heavy memory usage, which will be resolved in future iterations;<br>
</li>
<li>fonts may not appear correctly at first throughout the app.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="how-to-use" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use</h2>

<p>If you want to download and explore the app, please and use the following login credentials to view an account with pre-loaded data:<br>
username: <em>tester</em><br>
password: <em>password</em></p>

<p><em>Please note that Kitchen has only been designed to work on an iPad (4th Generation) running iOS 8, currently. It will run on other devices running iOS 8, but you may experience multiple layout issues. You will also require an iOS Developer account to install the app on your device.</em></p>

<h2>
<a id="future-work" class="anchor" href="#future-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future work</h2>

<p>The Restaurant Ordering System is an ongoing project. Now that simple functionality has been implemented, the developer is working on enhancing the experience for chefs, and to cover less common use cases.</p>
